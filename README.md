# Innovest: Monte Carlo Simulations for Sector-Specific Portfolios, Individual Stocks & S&P 500 Index 

## Overview
In this portion of the project, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the market performance of three sector-specific portfolios (EV, AI, MV) and nine individual stocks (TSLA, LCID, F, MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, META, RBLX, AAPL) over the next 5 years. Additionally, we included the S&P 500 Index (SPY) as a benchmark for comparison. The simulations were run with an initial investment of $10,000 for each portfolio and stock.
